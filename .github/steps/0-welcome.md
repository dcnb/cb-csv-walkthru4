# Build Your Digital Collection with CollectionBuilder

Welcome! 🎉 This tutorial will guide you through creating a digital collection website using **CollectionBuilder**—a framework that transforms metadata into beautiful, searchable websites with maps, timelines, and visualizations.

You'll work entirely in **GitHub Codespaces** (a cloud-based development environment), so no software installation is required!

> [!TIP]
> **How this tutorial works:** This is built on top of the [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/){:target="_blank"} tutorial template. As you complete each step and commit your changes, GitHub will automatically check your work and post the next step in this Issue. If you're waiting and nothing happens, try **refreshing this page** (`Cmd+R` on Mac or `Ctrl+R` on Windows/Linux). The steps appear as comments below!

## About the Psychiana Collection

Robinson in Moscow, Idaho (1928-1948). The collection includes 66 items: photographs, radio programs, advertisements, and correspondence.
