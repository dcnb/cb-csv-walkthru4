# Build a Digital Collection with CollectionBuilder

Welcome! This interactive tutorial will guide you through creating a digital collection website using **CollectionBuilder**—a framework that transforms metadata into beautiful, searchable websites with maps, timelines, and visualizations.

**No software installation required!** You'll work entirely in GitHub Codespaces (a cloud-based development environment).

- ✅ Set up a development environment in GitHub Codespaces
- ✅ Work with collection metadata in CSV format

This will:
1. Create your own copy of this repository
2. Name it `my-psychiana-collection` (you can change this)
3. Set it as **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages hosting)

**After creating your repository:**

1. Wait about 20 seconds and refresh the page
2. Go to the **Issues** tab (second tab at the top, next to "Code")
3. Click on the issue titled "Build Your Digital Collection with CollectionBuilder"
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions!

The tutorial uses GitHub Codespaces, so everything happens in your browser. As you complete each step and push commits, an automated bot will check your work and reveal the next step - just like official GitHub Skills tutorials!

## 📚 About This Tutorial

This tutorial uses demo data from the **Psychiana Digital Collection** at the University of Idaho Library. Psychiana was a popular 20th-century mail-order "New Thought" religion founded by Frank B. Robinson in Moscow, Idaho. Operating from 1928-1948, it was one of the world's largest mail-order religions, reaching hundreds of thousands of subscribers worldwide through magazine advertisements (like the famous "I TALKED WITH GOD" campaign) and lessons sent by mail.

The demo collection includes:
- 📸 Photographs of Frank B. Robinson, his staff, and Psychiana headquarters
- 📻 Radio program recordings from the "Good News" series
- 📄 Advertisements, flyers, and business documents
- 📍 Geospatial data showing Psychiana's reach across the United States

## CollectionBuilder 

<https://collectionbuilder.github.io/>

CollectionBuilder is a project of University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu) (CDIL) following the [Lib-Static](https://lib-static.github.io/) methodology. 
Powered by the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modern static web stack, it puts collection metadata to work building beautiful sites.

The basic theme is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Metadata visualizations are built using open source libraries such as [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/), [Spotlight gallery](https://github.com/nextapps-de/spotlight), [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes), and [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).
Object metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.
