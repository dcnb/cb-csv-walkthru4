## About the Psychiana Digital Collection

The Psychiana Digital Collection documents one of the most fascinating religious movements of the 20th century.

### What Was Psychiana?

Psychiana was a mail-order religion founded by Frank B. Robinson in Moscow, Idaho in 1928. At its peak, it reached hundreds of thousands of subscribers worldwide through magazine advertisements and lessons sent by mail.

### The Collection

- **Photographs** of Frank B. Robinson, his staff, and Psychiana headquarters
- **Radio programs** from the "Good News" series
- **Advertisements and promotional materials**

The collection demonstrates Psychiana's innovative use of mass media and modern business techniques to spread its New Thought philosophy.
